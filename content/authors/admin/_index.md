## About Me

Natalie DeForest received her PhD in Biomedical Sciences and Bioinformatics from the University of California (UC) San Diego. Her research interests center on harnessing the power of human genetics, bioinformatics, and computational genomics to uncover and validate novel therapeutics as well as new biological insights (see the "Experience" page for more details). Outside of work, you can find her reading, rock climbing, or playing tennis.
